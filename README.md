Answer to the open Question:

To make a search more performant, there are several ways we could consider. To list a few:
1 - Database optimization: by optimizing queries, using indexing, sharding for distributed databases. 
2 - Caching: using Redis, for example, or HTTP caching, for frequently accessed data. 
3 - Designing the API or the general architecture of the application: reducing complexity, designing for horizontal scaling. 
4 - Code refactoring and optimization: optimizing algorithms or data structures used, eliminating bottlenecks.

These are just a few examples, but all of this would depend on the use of metrics and data, monitoring various stages of the API in order to identify critical points.
