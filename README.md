I wasn't able to create a frontend project within the allotted time. 
As my focus has always been on backend, I can even develop front-ent. I can show you some projects, as available at: 
[Github Repo](https://github.com/mrfigueiredo/Frontend_Project)
But these projects take me hours to create. 
Regarding Event-driven programming, I couldn't find any situation in this project where it would be relevant to use it, and for the sake of time, I didn't add issues related to metrics, such as OTeL. 

Answer to the open Question:

To make a search more performant, there are several ways we could consider. To list a few:
1 - Database optimization: by optimizing queries, using indexing, sharding for distributed databases. 
2 - Caching: using Redis, for example, or HTTP caching, for frequently accessed data. 
3 - Designing the API or the general architecture of the application: reducing complexity, designing for horizontal scaling. 
4 - Code refactoring and optimization: optimizing algorithms or data structures used, eliminating bottlenecks.

These are just a few examples, but all of this would depend on the use of metrics and data, monitoring various stages of the API in order to identify critical points.
